Abstract—This paper deals with the analysis based on covid-19 vaccine tweets. VADER analysis which is a type of intensity or sentiment analysis is used to find the polarity score of the tweets and classify them as positive, negative, or neutral. The main objective is to derive the emotion of the majority about the vaccine which in turn could encourage or discourage people from vaccinating. This study provides insight into how people feel about vaccines in general. Moreover, the direct tweets on Twitter affect the idea of vaccination in many people since Twitter is a highly-influential social platform. The data contains id, text, retweets, and favorites. We use VADER analysis to compute the overall polarity score. From the obtained results, we interpret and visualize.

Keywords—VADER Analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis, Covid-19 Vaccines.
